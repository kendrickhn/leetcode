# LeetCode Journal ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š

This repository is a personal tracker for all LeetCode problems I've solved, including:
- âœ… Solved independently
- ðŸ¤– Solved with AI help
- ðŸ“ˆ Visual analytics of my growth and focus areas

## Structure

```

## Logging New Solutions

1. Add your code to `problems/<level>/id_title_self.py` or `id_title_ai.py`
2. Log the problem to `progress/log.csv`
3. (Optional) Write your analysis in `solutions/<id>.md`

## Future plans
- Weekly visualizations
- Tag-based filtering
- Time to solve stats
